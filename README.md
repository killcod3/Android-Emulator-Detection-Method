# Android Emulator Detector

A Java-based Android Emulator Detector that checks multiple characteristics of a device to determine if it's running on an emulator. The detection method attempts to identify various popular emulators like Nox Player, Genymotion, and LDPlayer, among others.

## Features

This Android Emulator Detector checks for:

1. Build properties (specific to emulators)
2. Emulator-specific files
3. Telephony Manager properties
4. Pipes related to the QEMU emulator
5. QEMU driver file
6. QEMU properties

## Usage

1. Copy the `emucheck.java` file into your project.
2. Use the `isEmulator(Context)` function in your code to check if the device is an emulator.

```java
import android.content.Context;
import your.package.name.EmulatorDetector;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        if (EmulatorDetector.isEmulator(this)) {
            // Device is an emulator
        } else {
            // Device is a physical device
        }
    }
}
```
 ## Disclaimer
 
 The provided method attempts to detect a wide range of emulators but may not cover all cases. Emulator developers continuously work on improving their software to avoid detection. To maintain the effectiveness of the detection method, update the detection methods regularly, and stay informed about the latest updates and techniques used by emulator developers. No emulator detection method is foolproof. Developers often use a combination of server-side and client-side detection techniques to reduce the chance of false positives and false negatives.
